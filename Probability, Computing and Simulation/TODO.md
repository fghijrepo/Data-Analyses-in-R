TODO list

Name: Funfay Jen

## Milestones for the Term Project

* [] Read section 5.6 of Simulation and understand the math and pseudocodes for simulating a Poisson process in a circular region (or potentially a square region, on which a 1D approximation might be more straightforward). (week 5)

* [] Implement step 1 in R. (week 6)

* [] Add a time axis and verify correctness. Look for ways to animate the time evolution. (week 7)

* [] Implement the animation. If there's time, read section 5.4 and implement the alternative approach of approximating the 2D Poisson process by a 1D Poisson process. (week 8)

* [] Continue working on the alternative approach. Maybe we don't have to *compare* them, but at least we can see whether both approaches work. Start documenting. (week 9)

* [] Document the project. Get ready for presentation. (week 10)
