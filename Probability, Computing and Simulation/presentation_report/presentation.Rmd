# Conceptual Understanding

## Converting a Poisson problem to an Exponential problem

- Utilize the relationship between a Poisson RV and an Exp RV
- More generally, the _Poisson-Gamma relationship_
- If the time between a certain type of event is exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda$, then the number of events in a given time period of length t follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda t$.
- Here, we take t to be an area.

# Implementation

## Dimension Reduction

> - The 2D Poisson process on a square region is easily converted to a 1D problem
> - In an R function, we only need to return the x-coordinates
> - This can lead to efficiency gains if we are to simulate the 2D process over and over

# Correctness Verification

## One Approach for Verifying the Correctness of Implementation

- Partition the the 2D region/ 1D interval
- Simulate the Poisson process many times
- The resulting counts in each disjoint subset should follow an appropriate Poisson distribution
- We can also vary the **area** of the region and the **Poisson rate** to see how things change

# Visualization
## Animating the 2D Poisson process

- Once the implementation passes the correctness check, we are ready to put the function to use
- We can visualize the 2D Poisson process in a less boring way by adding a time axis and animating the (approximate) Poisson process
